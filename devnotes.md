Removed the `exercises` app. Recreating it with

Trying to implement exercises at `react.js>Main Concepts` but limited success with create-react-app. Next, will research.

Experimenting with doing all exercises in Main Concepts. Setup lacking. Will follow [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) for an example of how to set up other exercises in the React docs.
