Not able to `yarn start`. Next time, will continue to debug.

Removed the `exercises` app. Recreating it with

`npx create-react-app exercises --use-npm`

There is success! The twirling atom is seen at `http://localhost:3000/`.

Trying to implement exercises at `react.js>Main Concepts` but limited success with create-react-app. Next, will research.

Experimenting with doing all exercises in Main Concepts. Setup lacking. Will follow [https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) for an example of how to set up other exercises in the React docs.

Completed thru '2. Introducing JSX'.

Practicing at most glancing at the example code in the React docs, writing it out with minimal editor help, debugging as necessary, and only then looking back at the example code to fix anything. Building muscle memory for quick coding, especially in technical interviews. Keeping up with one numbered section per session.
